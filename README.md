# qr-code-component
Practicing basic HTML and CSS as a beginner using the Frontend mentor "QR code Component" challenge
I started by creating a main container in which all of the elements would be and this would be the main QR code box centered in the page.
Within this container I then added the elements and adjusted the CSS to match the original image as much as possible
a challenge I came across was creating the flexbox within another flexbox so that there would be that white gap around the elements instead of fully occupying the width and height of the container


*edit

After some feedback on the initial challenge, I went back and corrected a few mistakes.

I was cluttering the stylesheet to begin with. I made sure I created the flexbox with a set width so it wouldn't stretch with the window. Once this was done, styling within the flexbox was a lot easier and made more sense.
I also learned I could copy the github file path's directly from the repository instead of hoping I typed it in correctly, so I knew there couldn't be any user error there. This successfully linked my image/font as needed.
