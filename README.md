# qr-code-component
Practicing basic HTML and CSS as a beginner using the Frontend mentor "QR code Component" challenge
I started by creating a main container in which all of the elements would be and this would be the main QR code box centered in the page.
Within this container I then added the elements and adjusted the CSS to match the original image as much as possible
a challenge I came across was creating the flexbox within another flexbox so that there would be that white gap around the elements instead of fully occupying the width and height of the container
